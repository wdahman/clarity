Badges provide a method to highlight a count of an element either next to it or inside the element itself.

## Usage

Badges have a colorful, bold, and filled style that makes them stand out when appearing within or next to another component. Badges are also small enough to fit next to or within another element.

## Anatomy

### Overall Style

Badges have a more rounded border radius, similar to labels, to distinguish them from primary buttons.

Badges are also small enough to fit next to or within another element.

### Over 99

If a badge needs to display a number above 99, use “99+” instead of the number unless the number is important to the user’s objectives and you are certain there is room in the design to accommodate it.

<!-- [//]: # IMAGE - inbox (1) -->

### Color

You can use different colors in badges.

Stoplight colors are reserved to display a sense of urgency or indicate state.

## Content

Use integers within badges. If you’re attempting to use text, consider using a label instead.
