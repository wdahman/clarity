[WCAG Guideline 2.4.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#bypass-blocks)

##### Requirement

Every page needs a "Skip to Content" link if the first action after page load is a tab press. The skip to content link needs to follow the link, keyboard focus, and color requirements.

##### Reasons

It takes a long time for written text to announce, 3X longer than the average visual reader. This allows a screen reader user to quickly hop into the center of the page, bypassing all the navigation.

##### Details

1.  Minimum required is "Skip to Content". You can also add "Skip to wherever" such as "skip to footer".
2.  Should be hidden if the tab key is not pressed after page load.
