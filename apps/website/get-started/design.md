# Designing with Clarity

We provide designers with a number of resources to help them design assets that align with the Clarity Design System.

Jumpstart your project with our Figma-based design resources. Start by downloading the [Metropolis fonts](https://github.com/chrismsimpson/Metropolis). Then download your resources of choice. We recommend that with your UI Library selection, that you also select the matching Icon Library as the two work together.

## Available Resources

Below are several resources that you'll likely want to download or bookmark for your design work.

#### Metropolis - Primary Font

Clarity uses the Metropolis font as a foundation, and you'll want to install it to ensure that the design system looks the same on your designs.
